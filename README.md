# Cohire Coding Challenge (Frontend)

### Introduction 
Welcome! This coding challenge is designed to explore your frontend skills. You will have to create a simple SPA based off the provided mockup and make a few API calls to a public web API.

### The challenge
Based off this [mockup], create a search page that allows searching for movies as keywords are typed into the search bar. The results should be displayed in a visually appealing manner. 

Movie data can be queried via: 
- [theMovieDB]

### Additional notes
- The wordings in the mockup are not necessarily accurate
- As illustrated in the mockup, the search bar is made up of two sections. The section labeled as 'Where' must have a fixed width of 200px, while the section labeled as 'Developer' should be responsive
- Any image assets can be grabbed from [cohire's website]

### Submission guide
Please fork this repo and drop your contact person a note once you are done

### Technology
At Cohire we predominantly use React for our frontend, and hence you are highly encouraged to use that for this challenge as well. However if React is not something you are comfortable with, please feel free to utilize other frontend frameworks or go for native HTML/CSS. Feel free to use any libraries.

### How we review
- **Design**: Were you able to translate the mockup into a web application that works well on various browsers and devices?
- **UI**: For the parts that were not covered under the mockup, were you able to create design those parts such in a way that was aesthetically pleasing and in-line with the general design?
- **Code quality**: Is the code easy to understand and maintain? Is the coding style consistent with the language's best practices? Do you demonstrate a good grasp of JavaScript, especially ES6?
- **Performance**: Does the UI render quickly? Are the choice of libraries etc appropriate for the web page?

### Bonus points
- **Documentation** - Is the README well written? Are the commit messages clear?
- **Automated Tests** - Are there any automated frontend tests?
- **Production-readiness** - Is there proper error handling? Is the code ready to to put into production?
- **Future-readiness** - Web workers? PWA? Client-side caching?
