# Cohire Coding Challenge (Frontend)

### Introduction 
Welcome! This coding challenge is designed to explore your frontend skills. You will have to create a simple SPA based off the provided mockup and make a few API calls to a public web API.

### The challenge
Create a search page that allows searching for movies as keywords are typed into the search bar. The results should be displayed in a visually appealing manner. The search page should follow your interpretation of cohire's branding, and you can use this [mockup] for reference, but please do not follow it. 

Movie data can be queried via: 
- [theMovieDB]

### Submission guide
Please fork this repo and drop your contact person a note once you are done

### Technology
At Cohire we predominantly use React for our frontend, and hence you are highly encouraged to use that for this challenge as well. 

### How we review
- **Design**: Were you able to translate the mockup into a web application that works well on various browsers and devices?
- **UI**: For the parts that were not covered under the mockup, were you able to create design those parts such in a way that was aesthetically pleasing and in-line with the general design?
- **Code quality**: Is the code easy to understand and maintain? Is the coding style consistent with the language's best practices? Do you demonstrate a good grasp of JavaScript, especially ES6?
- **Performance**: Does the UI render quickly? Are the choice of libraries etc appropriate for the web page?

### Bonus points
- **Documentation** - Is the README well written? Are the commit messages clear?
- **Automated Tests** - Are there any automated frontend tests?
- **Production-readiness** - Is there proper error handling? Is the code ready to to put into production?
- **Future-readiness** - Web workers? PWA? Client-side caching?
